You'll need the following:

Polyglot - you can get this from an installation of Winboard and that can be found here: http://www.open-aurec.com/wbforum/viewtopic.php?t=51528
ChessBridge - get it from here: https://github.com/Xyrus2000/ChessBridge

Follow the ChessBridge Readme instructions and use this Polyglot.ini file - you may wish to reduce the number of threads and the hash size depending on your processor and RAM availability.
